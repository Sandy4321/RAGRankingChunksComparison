The Earth always goes through hot and cold phases.
It is just a theory invented by scientists.
That is probably because of the sun getting hotter.
Some people just want more taxes.
"Trees help with everything, right?"
I do not know much about that.
Climate change is about changes in the environment caused by both natural events and some human actions.
I think animals have something to do with it.
I heard it is not real and will go away soon.
It is mostly a problem in big cities.
Probably aliens are causing it.
People should stop driving so many cars.
"Climate change involves significant changes in global temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns over decades or longer. The primary driver today is human activity, particularly the emission of greenhouse gases from burning coal, oil, and gas, deforestation, and industrial processes."
It is the same thing as the ozone hole.
There is no proof it is actually happening.
Governments use it to control us.
Climate change is when the Earth is weather changes a lot over time. Some people say humans are causing it by polluting the air.
It is mostly about recycling more.
I saw a video saying it is fake news.
Scientists believe that the planet is getting warmer due to things like pollution and cutting down trees.
Global warming and climate change are different things.
Something about the weather changing?
Maybe it is when the seasons get mixed up.
"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These changes may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities—especially burning fossil fuels—have been the main cause. This releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures."
It has something to do with rising temperatures and ice melting. I think cars and factories might be part of the problem.
I think it is just a hoax.
