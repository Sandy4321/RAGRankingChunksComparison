"Climate change involves significant changes in global temperature, precipitation, and wind patterns over decades or longer. The primary driver today is human activity."
It has something to do with rising temperatures and ice melting. I think cars and factories might be part of the problem.
Scientists believe that the planet is getting warmer due to things like pollution and cutting down trees.
Climate change is when the Earth is weather changes a lot over time. Some people say humans are causing it by polluting the air.
I do not know much about that.
"Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns. These changes may be natural, but since the 1800s, human activities is the main cause."
Climate change is about changes in the environment caused by both natural events and some human actions.
