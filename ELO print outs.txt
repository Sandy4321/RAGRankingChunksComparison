❓ What causes rainfall in the water cycle?
  1. (1303.1) Rainfall happens when water vapor condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall.
  2. (1234.6) precipitation happens when liquid steam condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall.
  3. (1063.3) precipitation occurs when the ground releases stored moisture upward.
  4. (1030.1) Rainfall occurs when the ground releases stored moisture upward.
  5. ( 979.5) Green vegetation capture solar light to drive photo-synthesis, making the sugars they need to live.
  6. ( 976.8) Green plants capture sunlight to drive photosynthesis, making the sugars they need to live.
✓ Ground-truth : Rainfall happens when water vapor condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall.

❓ Why must green plants receive sunlight?
  1. (1321.9) Green plants capture sunlight to drive photosynthesis, making the sugars they need to live.
  2. (1275.2) Green vegetation capture solar light to drive photo-synthesis, making the sugars they need to live.
  3. ( 979.6) Rainfall happens when water vapor condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall.
  4. ( 969.7) precipitation happens when liquid steam condenses into droplets that become heavy enough to fall.
  5. ( 969.3) Plants need sunlight mainly to warm their roots during the day.
  6. ( 969.0) The stomach churns food and mixes it with acid and enzymes to begin breaking it down.
